As a language learner, sometimes I have audio resources on hand (such as lots of posdcasts online), but have not 
scripts. I often got very frustrated when I cannot hear some words. With a quick Google, a bunch of premium on-line
audio-to-text services exist. However, I only have some small audio snippets and got reluctant to pay for it.
Here, I found a very useful [Google Web Speech Demonstration Website][demon] that could help.
All you need to do is enabling microphone access in your browser and clicking the microphone icon.
When you play your audio, the website recognizes the voice in real time and prints them out.
You can even bridge your audio output directly to the website with some simple setup using [Soundflower][sf].
In this way, the website captures the audio directly, avoiding influences of noises around you.

But please note that this website is only for demonstration, Google restricts the maximum length of each translation.
This is more than enough when you seek for help if your encounter difficulties in practicing listening skills.
When you have a lengthy audio to translate, you'd better subscribe to a premium service.
