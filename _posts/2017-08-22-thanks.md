Well. Finally got a chance to hold a personal academic website and blogs. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Thank Steven V. Miller for this great [post](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/). Also refer to [Github pages official site][gh help] for further help when integrating with Github Pages.
