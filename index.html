<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research. Iâ€™m currently a postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://s2.ist.psu.edu/">Prof. Peng Liu's group</a> at <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">the Pennsylvania State University</a>.
	Before working as a post-doc at Penn State, I received my BS degree from <a href="http://www.ustc.edu.cn/">the University of Science and Technology of China</a>, and my PhD from <a href="http://iie.ac.cn/">the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> in 2015. 
<p/>

<p>
	My research interests cover a wide range of systems security, including mobile security and IoT systems security. 
I am especially interested in leveraging COTS hardware
components/features to design and build systems that are more reliable and secure
than solutions based on software alone.	
	I
discovered that while emerging hardware components are primarily designed for
performance improvement, they can be leveraged to facilitate security solution
development, and the resulting systems are often superior to software alone
approaches in terms of efficiency, robustness and more importantly, security.

	My PHD dissertation focuses on utilizing CPU caches to hide critical data such as
	cryptographic keys in a computing system (appears in <em>IEEE S&P</em> and <em>NDSS</em>). At Penn State, I'm more interested in the security of mobile devices. We developed a system that shields COTS binaries to securely execute on the ARM platform with TrustZone (appears in <em>MobiSys</em>), and a bare-metal malware analysis platform for Android that could restore the host system to a clean-state snapshot in 2.80 seconds (appears in <em>ACSAC</em>). 
<p/>
<p>
	I'm now working on the security of IoT systems running on
    low-end microcontrollers. We have disclosed a vulnerability that appears in many telematics devices (appears in <em>SenSys</em>). 	
I found that many security mechanisms designed for high-end processors are not directly
applicable to the low-end ARM microcontroller, which unfortunately contributes a large slice of consumer market.
How to transparently apply existing security
techniques to microcontroller based IoT devices remains an open question. With the emergency of
IoT technology, the urgency to reinforce the protection of these cheap hardware
has never been higher.
