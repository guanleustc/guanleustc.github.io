<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research. Iâ€™m currently a Postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://s2.ist.psu.edu/">Cyber Security Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">the Pennsylvania State University,</a>.</p>
	<p>Before working as a post-doc at Penn State, I received my BS degree from <a href="http://www.ustc.edu.cn/">the University of Science and Technology of China</a>, and my PhD from <a href="http://iie.ac.cn/">the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> in 2015. My research interests cover a wide range of system security. My PHD dissertation focuses on hiding critical data such as
	cryptographic keys in a computing system (appears in <em>IEEE S&P</em> and <em>NDSS</em>). At Penn State, I'm more interested in the security of mobile devices. I developed a system that shields COTS binaries to securely execute on the ARM platform with TrustZone (appears in <em>MobiSys</em>), and a bare-metal malware analysis platform for Android that could restore to a clean snapshot in 2.80 seconds (appears in <em>ACSAC</em>). I'm now working on the security of IoT systems running on
    low-end micro controller units. We disclosed a vulnerability that appears in many telematics devices (appears in <em>SenSys</em>). The purpose of this research is to provide comprehensive protection for devices of several bucks.
