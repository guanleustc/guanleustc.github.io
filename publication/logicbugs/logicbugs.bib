In  recent  years,  IoT  platforms  and  systems  have been   rapidly   emerging.   Although   IoT   is   a   new   technology, new  does  not  mean  simpler  (than  existing  networked  systems). Contrarily,  the  complexity  (of  IoT  platforms  and  systems)  is actually  being  increased  in  terms  of  the  interactions  between the  physical  world  and  cyberspace.  The  increased  complexity indeed results in new vulnerabilities. This paper seeks to provide a  review  of  the  recently  discovered  logic  bugs  that  are  specific to IoT platforms and systems and discuss the lessons we learned from  these  bugs.  In  particular,  20  logic  bugs  and  one  weakness falling into seven categories of vulnerabilities are reviewed in this survey.
