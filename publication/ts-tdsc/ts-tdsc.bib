 abstract = {The rapid evolution of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies has led to an emerging need to make them smarter. However, the smartness comes at the cost of multi-vector security exploits. From cyber space, a compromised operating system could access all the data in a cloud-aware IoT device. From physical space, cold-boot attacks and DMA attacks impose a great threat to the unattended devices.},
